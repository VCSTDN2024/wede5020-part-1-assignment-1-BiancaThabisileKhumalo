2. History of the Business
Urban Auto Hub was founded in 2023 in Johannesburg, South Africa, as a modern alternative to traditional car service centers. It was established by a team of young automotive professionals and entrepreneurs who identified a gap in the market for tech-forward, urban-friendly vehicle services.
The company started by offering express car maintenance in business parks and city centers, later expanding into electric vehicle (EV) services, vehicle infotainment upgrades, and premium car detailing.
The idea was simple: bring convenience, speed, and smart technology to South African vehicle owners who live busy urban lives.
Urban Auto Hub operates with a focus on efficiency, digital integration, and eco-conscious service options, setting itself apart as a forward-thinking brand in the automotive service industry.

3. Target Audience

•	Car Enthusiasts: Customers interested in tech upgrades, infotainment, and premium detailing services.
