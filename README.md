# Urban Auto Hub Website

**Responsive Website Proposal for Urban Auto Hub – Johannesburg, South Africa**

This repository contains the planning and structure for the official Urban Auto Hub website. The project is based on original documentation created in 2025 and integrates responsive design principles, modular CSS architecture, and brand-specific styling.

## Business Overview

Urban Auto Hub is a tech-forward automotive service brand founded in 2023. Based in Johannesburg, it caters to busy urban professionals, EV owners, and car enthusiasts looking for fast, modern, and premium car care.


## Project Goals

- Launch a mobile-first, responsive website  
- Enable real-time booking and service availability  
- Educate users on EV ownership and maintenance  
- Integrate WhatsApp, live chat, and social media  
- Increase online bookings by 30% within 6 months  


## Design & UX Strategy

- Mobile-first layout with collapsible menus and adaptive grids  
- Breakpoints optimized for 550px and 768px  
- Modular CSS files per page (e.g., `index.css`, `booking.css`)  
- Alt text, keyboard navigation, and high contrast for accessibility  
- Typography: Montserrat (headings), Open Sans (body), Roboto (buttons)  
- Colour palette: Deep Blue `#003366`, Slate Grey `#666666`, Light Blue `#3399FF`, Electric Blue `#00BFFF`, White `#FFFFFF`  
- Navigation bar: horizontal layout with hover effect switching from Slate Grey to Electric Blue  
- Buttons: styled with Electric Blue, hover/active states increase font size slightly  
- Images: all visuals use `max-width: 100%` for clean scaling across devices
